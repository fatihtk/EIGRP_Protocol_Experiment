# EIGRP_Protocol_Experiment

This study was created with GNS3 as an example to enable computers in different networks to communicate with each other within the specified rules. Core routers communicate with ospf protocol, core network and other routers communicate with EIGRP protocol. The aim of this study is to create a stable network structure that meets the requirements. Port numbers and router names are pictured as additional documentation for editing and modification. Routers do not have any password.
